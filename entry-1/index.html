    Things needed - a deck of cards

    It could be played anywhere- in a bus, car or even in a flight
    <br> with a group of people sitting close to each other.

  <div class="theory">
    <p>Discard a Jack from the deck<br>
      Distribute the cards to all the players equally and getting one less or more card is fine.<br>
Look at the cards and discard all the pairs with the same numbers.<br>
When every body has discarded all the pairs they had, the game shall start.<br>
The player that has the least number of cards in his hand shall pick a random card from the player on his right.<br>
And if the picked card makes a pair with any of the other card in his hand, he shall discard the pair.<br>
Similarly the next person on right will pick a card from the next player on his right an so on.<br>
As soon as all of your cards got their pairs and you have no cards left in your hands, you shall win.<br>
And the rest of the players will continue the same thing until all of their cars are also not discarded.<br>
The last player will be left with a single Jack in his hand and will become the JACK THIEF.
